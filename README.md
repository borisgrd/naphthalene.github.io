Poker, over the air!

# Wat #

This is a simple chromecast application to play a game of poker with
your friends on your TV. Each player has a laptop or Android app (maybe
iOS in the future) that shows their deck of cards. The game including
the pot, flipped cards and player scores are shown on the TV.
